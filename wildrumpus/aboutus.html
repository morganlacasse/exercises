            <p>
                <br>

                During its twenty-five-year course, Wild Rumpus has had a sort of conversation with the book The
                Salamander Room by Anne Mazer. In 1992, we first used this story as a kind of blueprint for building the
                store. And today it continues to teach us about books and young people, and about adults who love them.
                <br><br>
                Alone, Brian goes into the woods, discovers a salamander and takes it home to his bedroom. Each page of
                the story that follows is driven by his off-stage mother's questions. And for each question, Brian has
                an answer. His answers both accommodate the new salamander and magically transform the world of his
                bedroom. Each illustration shows a step in a process that changes a conventional interior to an
                exterior: gradually walls and ceilings disappear, wildlife moves in and then takes Brian and the reader
                back out. And at the end, the last pages show Brian sound asleep in his bed in the woods . . . "and next
                to me, on the boulder with its head resting on soft moss, the salamander will sleep."
                <br><br>
                <img class="img_about" src="img/spike.jpg" style="clear: left;" width="280" height="198" alt="intersting lizard">



                Architecture doesn't have the luxury of page-turning, but instead allows us a front-to-back spatial
                progression. Our store's front doors open into a fairly conventional interior with carpet, a comfortable
                reading chair and floorlamp. Midway, things begin to change, there's a tree-trimmer sheetrocked in the
                ceiling on a ladder, and the ceiling itself at this point starts to crack open to the sky. At the back,
                with birds above and rats beneath a garden shed, the store wants you to feel like you're outside.
                <br><br>
                Besides feeding us a design concept, there are other, deeper layers of flavor in this favorite book.
                It's a story about parenting. Brian's mother, instead of screaming, "Where have you been? How many times
                have I
            </p>

                <p>
                    told you not to wander off into those woods alone?
                 And I just cleaned your room and what's that
                slimey animal doing in your drawer? Brian!" Not so in this book. This mother asks simple questions, not
                in an interrogating, punishing way, but more as little gifts that honor and nourish her son's
                intelligence.
                <br><br>

                <img class="img_about" src="img/ethelcarl.jpg" style="clear: left;" width="280" height="186" alt="look at all those chickens">
                Woody Allen once confessed that he'd always felt "at two with nature." A recent radio commentator
                lamented that parents no longer allow their children "to play on the edges of civilization." Instead too
                many children today are willingly tethered to indoor technology and self-sequestered away from the
                natural world. This book is all but literally eliminating the distinctions between indoors and outdoors.
                Remember, the salamander is an amphibian--it lives and breathes by moving back and forth between water
                and earth. In mythology, the salamander is associated with the fourth element, fire. One explanation is
                that the amphibian hibernates in logs which, when brought inside to fuel a winter fire resulted in the
                salamander's sudden appearance among the flames.
                <br><br>

                </p>

                <p>

                In the beginning, Brian may bring nature in the form of a salamander inside
                to his bedroom, but by the end, the salamander--throughout a silent chorus--has torn off the ceiling,
                broken down the walls and thus shows us how transient all of our shelters really are. No matter what we
                construct or how hard we try to wrap and protect ourselves, there's really no way to avoid the truth
                that we all live together and sleep together in nature's great and only salamander room. -Tom

            <p>
                <br>

                Contrary to popular belief, our feline friends did not lose their tails to a slamming door, or a grabby
                toddler, or even a boating accident. They are naturally tail-less! They are a breed of cat called Manx
                which originated on the Isle of Man. The lack of tail or nubby tail is the result of a genetic mutation.
                They are also known for having personalities that are more like dogs, thus making them the perfect match
                for our wild little bookstore!
