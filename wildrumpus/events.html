                    <a href="https://www.rebeccaansari.com/" target="_blank">Rebecca Ansari</a> lives in a very loud
                    house in Minneapolis with her husband, four boys, two huge dogs and a fluffy kitty. After twelve
                    years as an ER doctor, she shed her scrubs to write magical and mysterious worlds for middle-grade
                    readers. She is drawn to any story that evokes, "Please, Mom! Just one more chapter!" and she
                    strives to craft the same. Rebecca was the winner of the Minnesota SCBWI Mentorship for 2015. When
                    she isn't writing, you can find her biking, cooking or escaping "up north" with family, friends, and
                    a stack of good books.

                    We are honored to welcome <a href="https://www.rodaworld.com/" target="_blank">Roda Ahmed</a>,
                    author of Mae Among the Stars, to Wild Rumpus! Her beautiful
                    picture book about Mae Jemison, the first African American woman to travel in space, has received
                    much well-deserved acclaim and is a perfect book to inspire young feminists, regardless of gender.

                    <a href="https://www.rodaworld.com/" target="_blank">Roda Ahmed</a> is a Norwegian author and
                    columnist born in Hargeisa, Somalia. Roda is the bestselling
                    author of Forberedelsen (The Preparations). Mae Among the Stars is her first children’s book. She
                    can speak five languages: Somali, Arabic, Norwegian, English, and French. Roda lives in LA with her
                    husband and two children. 





                    <br><br>

                    A beautiful picture book for sharing, inspired by the life of the first African American woman to
                    travel in space, Mae Jemison.

                    A great classroom and bedtime read-aloud, Mae Among the Stars is the perfect book for young readers
                    who have big dreams and even bigger hearts!

                    When Little Mae was a child, she dreamed of dancing in space. She imagined herself surrounded by
                    billions of stars, floating, gliding, and discovering.

                    She wanted to be an astronaut.

                    Her mom told her, "If you believe it, and work hard for it, anything is possible.”

                    Little Mae’s curiosity, intelligence, and determination, matched with her parents' encouraging
                    words, paved the way for her incredible success at NASA as the first African American woman to
                    travel in space.

                    This book will inspire other young girls to reach for the stars, to aspire for the impossible, and
                    to persist with childlike imagination.

                    An entrancing adventure story for today’s troubled planet, The Casket of Time is a fantastical tale
                    of time travel and environmental calamity from celebrated Icelandic author Andri Snær Magnason.
                    <br><br>
                    Teenage Sigrun is sick of all the apocalyptic news about the “situation” and, worse, her parents’
                    obsession with it. Sigrun’s family—along with everyone else—decides to hibernate in their
                    TimeBoxes®, hoping for someone else to fix the world’s problems . But when Sigrun’s TimeBox® opens
                    too early, she discovers an abandoned city overrun by wilderness and joins a band of kids who are
                    helping a researcher named Grace solve the “situation.”
                    <br><br>
                    The world, according to Grace, is under an ancient curse. There once was a princess named Obsidiana,
                    who was trapped in time by the greedy king of Pangea. To protect Obsidiana from dark and gloomy
                    days, the king put her in a crystal casket made of spider silk woven so tightly that time itself
                    couldn’t penetrate. The king’s greed for power doomed his kingdom and the trapped princess. Sigrun
                    sees eerie parallels between the tale of Obsidiana and the present-day crisis, and realizes it’s up
                    to her and her friends to break the ancient curse and fix the world.

                    <br><br>
